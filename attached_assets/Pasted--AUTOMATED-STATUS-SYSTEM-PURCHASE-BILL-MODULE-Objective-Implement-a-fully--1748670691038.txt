🛠️ AUTOMATED STATUS SYSTEM – PURCHASE BILL MODULE

---

### 🔹 Objective:

Implement a fully **automated status assignment system** in the Purchase Bill module. Status must be:
- Automatically determined based on item receiving and payment data.
- Displayed in **Edit mode**, **View mode**, and **Purchase Bill List**.
- Consistent in **color** but must **not include any icons**.
- Displayed **only once** per page (especially in View mode).

---

### 🔹 Required Status Logic (MUST BE IMPLEMENTED EXACTLY):

1. **Draft**
   - When no items are received **AND**
   - Payment made = 0

2. **Partial Received**
   - Some items received, but not all quantities fully received
   - AND payment made = 0

3. **Partial Received & Partial Paid**
   - Some items received, not all fully
   - AND payment made > 0 but less than total bill amount

4. **Partial Received & Paid**
   - Some items received, not all fully
   - AND payment made = total bill amount

5. **Received**
   - All item quantities fully received
   - AND payment made = 0

6. **Received & Partial Paid**
   - All item quantities fully received
   - AND payment made > 0 but less than total bill amount

7. **Received & Paid**
   - All item quantities fully received
   - AND payment made = total bill amount

8. **Partial Paid**
   - No items received
   - AND payment made > 0 but less than total bill amount

9. **Paid**
   - No items received
   - AND payment made = total bill amount

### 🔹 Functional Notes:

- Status should be dynamically calculated in real-time in:
  - **Purchase Bill Create/Edit**
  - **Purchase Bill View**
  - **Purchase Bill List**
- Status is **read-only** (non-editable manually).
- Ensure status updates seamlessly upon **Save**, **Edit**, or **Reload**.
- Do not allow duplicated status display (especially in View mode – only one status badge should be shown).

---

### 🔹 Visual & UI Guidelines:

- All status badges must use consistent background/text color styles (e.g., blue, green, orange, etc.)
- **Do not use icons** alongside status labels.
- Make sure display styles are responsive and do not break the layout.
- No unnecessary delays in status rendering.
- Status logic must NOT affect or break existing calculation workflows (e.g., totals, balance, receiving quantity).

✅ Please double-check all views and thoroughly test using:
- Bills with no payments or items received
- Bills with partial/full payments and receiving combinations
- Edge cases (e.g., manually adjusting items or amounts after receiving)
