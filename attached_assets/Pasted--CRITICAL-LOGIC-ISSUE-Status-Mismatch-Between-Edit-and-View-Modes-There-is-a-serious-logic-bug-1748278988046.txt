🚨 CRITICAL LOGIC ISSUE: Status Mismatch Between Edit and View Modes

There is a serious logic bug where Purchase Bill status shows correctly in Edit mode but is **incorrectly shown as 'Draft'** in View mode, even when the bill is fully paid.

---

### 🔍 Observed Problem:

- A purchase bill with **full payment already made**:
  - In **Edit Mode**: Shows correct status `Paid`.
  - In **View Mode**: Incorrectly shows status as `Draft`.
- This creates confusion and misrepresents bill state in important views (especially for admins/auditors).

---

### ⚠️ Root Cause Assumption:

View and List modes are likely **not using the same status calculation logic** as Edit mode. This creates inconsistency between what users see while editing vs. what is shown after saving or reviewing the bill.

---

### ✅ Required Fix Instructions:

1. 🧠 **Extract Status Calculation Logic Into a Shared Utility Function**:
   - Move the bill status determination logic into a reusable function like `getPurchaseBillStatus(billData)` that:
     - Calculates status based on:
       - Total amount
       - Payment made
       - Received quantities
      

2. 📊 **Expected Status Logic**:

   | Criteria                                                                 | Status Output           |
   |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
   | No items received, no payment made                                      | `Draft`                 |
   | Some items received, some payment made                                  | `Partially Received`, `Partially Paid` |
   | All items received, some payment made                                   | `Received`, `Partially Paid` |
   | Some items received, full payment made                                  | `Partially Received`, `Paid` |
   | All items received, full payment made                                   | `Received`, `Paid`      |

3. 🔁 **Apply This Status Logic Uniformly**:
   - Use the shared status function in:
     - **Edit Mode** ✅
     - **View Mode** ❌ (currently incorrect — must update)
     - **List View** ❌ (also verify here)

4. 🧹 **Cleanup Requirements**:
   - ✅ Remove any hardcoded default status like `Draft` from View mode.
   - ❌ Do NOT show any status icons — use text-only badges.
   - ❌ Do NOT show status beside bill number in Purchase Bill View header.
   - ✅ Do NOT display "Current Status" section at the bottom in Edit view (unnecessary).

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria:

- Status logic behaves identically across **Edit**, **View**, and **List** modes.
- Fully paid bills do **not** show as `Draft`.
- Status labels reflect the actual saved bill data, not temporary UI state.
- No extra visual noise (icons, redundant status areas).

💡 Note:

Please fully test the fix using a bill that has:
- Multiple items
- Partial and full receipt cases
- Partial and full payments

Ensure View and List modes reflect exactly the same status shown in Edit mode.
