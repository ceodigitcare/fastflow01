üîß Critical Fix Prompt: Initial Balance √ó10 Scaling Issue Still Exists

Despite your recent fixes, the original issue **still persists**. When entering `12` as initial balance, the system still shows `120.00` in the Chart of Accounts display, which proves the √ó10 scaling bug is not resolved.

Please follow these updated and more rigorous debugging steps:

### ‚úÖ You MUST Log & Verify All 6 Stages of Value Transformation:

1. **Raw Input**
   - What value is received from the input field? (Check type and raw value: e.g., "12" as string or number)

2. **Form State**
   - How is this value stored in component state (e.g., `useState` or `formik`)? Confirm no implicit conversion is being applied.

3. **Pre-Submission Processing**
   - Are you applying `.toFixed()`, `parseFloat()`, or `value * 100` before sending it to mutation? Log it.

4. **Mutation / API Payload**
   - What is actually sent to backend? Log and inspect payload before the fetch/axios/post call.

5. **Backend (Mock or Real) Storage**
   - What value is being stored? If stored in cents, confirm it's exactly `input * 100`.

6. **UI Display Formatting**
   - Are you dividing back by 100 before showing in the UI? Confirm and log again.

### ‚ùå Current Bug Evidence:

| Input | Expected Display | Actual Display |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| 1     | $1.00            | $10.00         |
| 12    | $12.00           | $120.00        |
| 123.45| $123.45          | $1234.50       |

### ‚úÖ Must-Have Fixes Checklist:

- Ensure input is only multiplied once by 100 before storing (for cents).
- Ensure output is divided exactly once by 100 when displaying.
- Do not apply multiple conversions at multiple places.
- Use centralized helpers to handle currency transform if needed (e.g., `toCents`, `fromCents`).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Without fixing this, all financial reporting will be completely inaccurate. Please investigate this seriously, reproduce it with test data, and validate all 6 stages explicitly.**
