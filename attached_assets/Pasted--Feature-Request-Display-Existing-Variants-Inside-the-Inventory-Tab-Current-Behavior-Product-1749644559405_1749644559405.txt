📦 Feature Request: Display Existing Variants Inside the Inventory Tab
Current Behavior:

Product variants are created successfully with auto-generated SKUs and deletion functionality.

Variants are not visible or accessible from the Inventory tab after they are created.

When editing a product later, the previously created variants cannot be viewed directly within the product form.

✅ Proposed Improvement:
Goal:
Ensure users can view and manage all existing product variants directly from the Inventory tab, even after the initial creation. This will allow seamless review and prevent redundant variant generation.

🔍 What Needs to Change:
1. Show Existing Variants in the Inventory Tab
Under the Inventory tab of the product edit view, display a table/list of all generated variants.

For each variant, show:

Variant options (e.g., Size: Medium, Color: Red)

SKU (read-only unless empty)

Purchase price (optional display)

Delete icon

2. Avoid Re-generating the Same Variants
If variants already exist for a product:

Show them immediately on visiting the Inventory tab.

Disable re-generation unless new variant values are added.

Provide a “Generate More” option instead of “Generate All”.

3. Highlight Data Source
Add a simple label or tooltip next to purchase price/inventory fields like:

“Inventory is managed through purchase bills”

4. Preserve Variant Visibility Across Edits
Once variants are created, they should always be visible from the Inventory tab when the product is reopened for editing, without needing to re-add variant types.

💡 Benefits:
Prevents user confusion about whether variants were saved.

Eliminates unnecessary re-generation.

Gives a full snapshot of variant configuration in one place.

Aligns with inventory logic that’s now handled via purchase bills.

🧩 Example Layout (within Inventory tab):
Variant	SKU	Purchase Price	Delete
Red / Small	TSHIRT-RED-S	$10.00	🗑️
Blue / Medium	TSHIRT-BLU-M	$10.00	🗑️
