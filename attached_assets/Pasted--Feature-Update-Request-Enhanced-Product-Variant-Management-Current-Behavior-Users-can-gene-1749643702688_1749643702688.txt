🛠️ Feature Update Request: Enhanced Product Variant Management
Current Behavior:

Users can generate product variants (e.g., Size × Color combinations).

Variants currently support input for SKU, price, and inventory.

Issue:

Inventory should not be directly editable within the variant generation section.

There’s no persistent view of existing variants once created.

Variant SKUs and purchase prices are not handled in a controlled, default-driven way.

✅ Expected Changes:
1. Variant Inventory Input Removal
Remove the ability to enter or edit inventory quantity directly within the variant section of the product edit/create form.

Inventory should only be added via Purchase Bills, not directly in the variant UI.

2. Default SKU Handling for Variants
Each generated variant should receive a default SKU (e.g., based on the main product SKU + variant code).

Example: Product SKU: TSHIRT001 → Variant: TSHIRT001-RED-M

Allow users to manually override this SKU only if the new SKU is unique and not empty.

3. Purchase Price for Variants
Add a non-editable field showing the default purchase price for each variant.

Initially inherited from the main product or set manually if needed.

Only changeable via purchase bill (not in the variant section).

4. Persistent Variant Display
After variant generation:

Display all existing variants clearly in the UI (table or list view).

Allow user to review and reuse instead of re-generating the same combinations again.

New combinations can be added via the existing “Generate All” function.

5. Allow Deletion of Specific Variants
Let users delete any individual variant from the list (e.g., trash icon).

Ensure deletion logic updates the backend and cleans up SKU/indexing as needed.

6. Minimal Design Changes
Retain the current visual design layout and structure.

Add these capabilities within the existing variant tab/section without major UI overhaul.

🧩 Example Flow:
User creates product → Goes to Variant tab → Adds "Size" and "Color" → Clicks “Generate All”

Variants are shown like:

Variant	SKU	Purchase Price	[Delete]
Red / Small	TSHIRT001-RED-S	$10.00	🗑️
Red / Medium	TSHIRT001-RED-M	$10.00	🗑️
...	...	...	...

No inventory field here.

SKU is pre-filled but editable if empty.

Purchase price shown (non-editable).

“Generate All” can be used again if new variant values are added.

🎯 Outcome:
Prevents manual inventory mismanagement.

Promotes consistent SKU and pricing structure.

Improves reusability and visibility of variant data.

Keeps UI clean with minimal changes.
