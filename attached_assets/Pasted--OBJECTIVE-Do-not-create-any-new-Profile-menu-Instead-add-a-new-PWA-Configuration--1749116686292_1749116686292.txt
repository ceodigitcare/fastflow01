🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Do **not** create any new "Profile" menu. Instead, add a new **“PWA Configuration”** section **inside the existing “Profile” tab** located under the **Settings** menu.

This feature should allow the user to configure essential fields required for Progressive Web App (PWA) support directly from the Settings panel.

---

### 🔧 1. LOCATION OF PWA CONFIGURATION

➡️ Navigate to:
> `Settings → Profile tab`

Inside this existing tab, add a **PWA Configuration section** (as a collapsible or visible card).

---

### 🧩 2. REQUIRED INPUT FIELDS

The following fields must be added to the “PWA Configuration” section:

| Label           | Input Type | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| App Name        | Text        | Full name of the app, shown in install popup and launcher |
| Short Name      | Text        | A short identifier for compact display (e.g., home screen) |
| Theme Color     | Color Picker | Used in browser toolbar and splash screen background |
| Background Color| Color Picker | Sets background color for splash screen |
| App Icon        | **Drag & Drop file uploader** | Accepts `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.svg` files. Minimum size: **512x512px**. Show this info below the uploader in small text.|

Make sure the App Icon uploader supports **drag-and-drop** as well as manual file selection.

Under the uploader, display this note in smaller font:
> "Accepts .png, .jpg, .svg — Minimum size: 512x512 pixels."

### ⚙️ 3. FUNCTIONALITY

- These configurations should dynamically update the `manifest.json`.
- A valid `service-worker.js` must also be registered (if not already).
- Ensure all settings persist correctly and meet PWA installability criteria.

---

### 📌 4. INSTALL PROMPT IN BROWSER

Once configured correctly:

✅ Ensure the **“Install App” icon appears in the browser’s top-right corner** when the web app is visited in Chrome, Edge, or supported PWA browsers.

This is a critical confirmation of successful PWA support.

### 🚫 DO NOT:

- ❌ Do NOT create a new sidebar menu named “Profile”.
- ✅ Work strictly within `Settings → Profile` tab.
