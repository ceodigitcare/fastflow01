üéØ OBJECTIVE:
Implement full **Progressive Web App (PWA)** support from the settings panel ‚Äî specifically inside the existing **‚ÄúProfile‚Äù** section. The goal is to allow the application to be installable from the browser and customize key PWA configurations through user input.


### üîß 1. ADD A NEW SECTION INSIDE "PROFILE" CALLED `PWA CONFIGURATION`

Under the "Profile" or "Settings" module, create a dedicated expandable section titled:
> **PWA Configuration**

Inside this section, add the following input fields to collect PWA-related metadata from the user:

| Field Name        | Type     | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| App Name         | Text     | Full name of the app (e.g., ‚ÄúdigitCare ERP‚Äù)                         |
| Short Name       | Text     | Used when space is limited (e.g., mobile home screen)                |
| Theme Color      | Color    | Used in address bar and splash screen background                     |
| Background Color | Color    | Background color for the splash screen                               |
| App Icon         | File     | Accept `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.svg`. Preferably square (512x512 pixels) |

All fields should be editable and saved to the database or app config used to generate the `manifest.json`.

### üóÇ 2. OUTPUT MANIFEST.JS FILE BASED ON USER INPUT

When the user provides the above data and saves it:

- Dynamically generate or update the `manifest.json` file with the user-provided information.
- Ensure the file is accessible at:



---

### üí° 3. ENABLE PWA INSTALLATION ICON IN THE BROWSER

Ensure full PWA compliance by doing the following:

- Generate a valid `manifest.json` based on the config.
- Register a proper `service-worker.js` file to support caching and offline behavior.
- Make sure the application passes **Lighthouse PWA audit.**

‚úÖ **Critically Important**:  
When a user opens the web app on a supported browser (like Chrome), the **‚ÄúInstall App‚Äù icon must appear in the top-right corner of the browser address bar**.

---

### üß™ 4. PWA TEST BEHAVIOR

After implementing:

- Test on both **desktop and mobile browsers**.
- Ensure the app is installable with custom icon, name, and colors.
- Upon installation, the app should launch as a standalone window, **not in a browser tab**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTES

- Validate image upload for the App Icon (e.g., must be square and at least 192x192 or 512x512).
- Theme and background color inputs must use a color picker.
- The generated manifest must meet [Web App Manifest specs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).

---

### ‚úÖ END GOAL

Make it possible for any user to:
- Set and customize their app's PWA branding.
- Install the app directly from browser with correct metadata.
- Have a fully functioning, installable Progressive Web App.
