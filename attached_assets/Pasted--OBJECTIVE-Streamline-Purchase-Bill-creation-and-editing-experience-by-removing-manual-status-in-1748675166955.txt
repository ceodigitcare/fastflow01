ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE:
Streamline Purchase Bill creation and editing experience by removing manual status inputs, improving payment input UX, showing account balances, and fixing decimal precision in discount input.

### ðŸ”§ PART 1: REMOVE MANUAL STATUS DROPDOWN (Only in Create & Edit Views)

- **Remove the manual "Status" selection field** entirely from:
  - Purchase Bill **Create** view
  - Purchase Bill **Edit** view
- Status should now be shown as a **read-only, auto-calculated** field based on defined logic.
- The automatic status display must still appear in:
  - Purchase Bill **Edit**
  - Purchase Bill **View**
  - Purchase Bill **List**
- Ensure status is rendered **only once** per page (e.g., not twice in View mode).
- Maintain **consistent color styling**, **without any icons**.

### ðŸ’³ PART 2: IMPROVE "Payment Made" & "Pay From Account" UX

âœ… **Enhanced Layout**:
- Place the **"Pay From Account"** dropdown immediately **next to** the "Payment Made" input field.
- This dropdown should show all accounts under the `Cash and Bank` category.
- Display account balance inline with the account name using a dash:  
  Example: `Bkash - $3,420.00`, `Premium Bank - $15,000.00`

âœ… **New Actions for Payment Section**:
- Add a button: `âž• Add More Payment` â†’ Allows inserting multiple payment entries.
- Add another button: `ðŸ’¯ Make Full Payment` â†’ Fills the remaining due amount automatically.

âœ… **Editing Existing Payments**:
- In Edit mode, clearly show the **previously paid amount** beside or below the current Payment Made field.  
  Example: _"Previously Paid: $1,200.00"_

âœ… **Balance Validation**:
- When a user selects a Pay From account:
  - Show current account balance
  - **If payment exceeds available balance**, block submission and show error

### ðŸ§® PART 3: CRITICAL FIX â€“ Discount Field Decimal Support

- The "Total Discount" input field currently does **not support decimals after two digits**, which causes rounding or invalid entry issues.
- This is a **critical financial calculation bug** and must be fixed.
- The field should accept and retain values with **up to two decimal places** (e.g., `15.25`, `0.99`, `200.00`)
- Ensure correct formatting, validation, and compatibility with calculations.

---

âœ… **Final Expectations**:
- No manual status override in Create or Edit views
- More intuitive and informative payment process
- Clean, readable account dropdown with balances
- Accurate handling of decimal discounts
- Status and balance logic work seamlessly without impacting core calculations
