üîß Prompt for Fixing Broken Logout and Persistent PWA Settings Update Issue
Issue 1: Logout Functionality Broken

When I click "Logout", I am redirected to the login page briefly, but I am immediately logged back in and sent to the dashboard.

This happens regardless of which menu or page I am on.

It seems like the session or token is not being properly cleared, or there's an automatic re-authentication logic being triggered incorrectly.

Expected Behavior:

After clicking "Logout":

The authentication token/session should be cleared (e.g., cookies, localStorage, or JWT).

The user should stay on the login screen unless they explicitly log in again.

Issue 2: PWA Settings Still Not Updating

The ‚ÄúUpdate PWA Settings‚Äù button still shows:
Failed to update PWA settings. Please try again.

The icon preview is now clean (no URL shown), but the settings still fail to save, even when all fields are valid.

No detailed validation or backend error message is shown to help identify the issue.

‚úÖ Developer Action Checklist
üîí Logout Fix:
Ensure that logout() method:

Clears authentication token or session completely.

Redirects user to login page without reinitializing auth state from persisted memory (e.g., cookies or localStorage).

Check if useEffect() or authProvider is auto-logging in on load using leftover credentials.

üõ†Ô∏è PWA Settings Update Fix:
Frontend:

Check if the form state is actually updated when the icon is changed or removed.

Confirm the form submit handler sends a valid payload.

Backend:

Check whether the request is received with valid headers and auth context.

Add clear debug logs if validation fails on specific fields (e.g., app name, icon URL, theme color).

Return clear, field-specific errors instead of a generic error string.

üîç Additional Suggestion:
Enable browser dev tools or console logs to trace:

Request/response headers during logout

PWA form submit payload and server response

Any unexpected localStorage/sessionStorage activity during auth flow
