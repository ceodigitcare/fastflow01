üîß Prompt for Resolving PWA Settings Update Error and UI Clean-Up
Issue Summary:
Even after implementing the static file upload system and removing blob URLs:

The icon URL still appears as plain text or metadata next to the image in the UI ‚Äî this should be hidden from users.

Clicking ‚ÄúUpdate PWA Settings‚Äù still triggers the error:
Failed to update PWA settings. Please try again.
even though all visible fields appear to be valid.

‚úÖ Expected Behavior:
Clean UI for Uploaded Icon:

Only show the image preview, not the static file URL or any blob:/file path next to it.

Allow the user to remove and replace the icon via the "Remove Icon" button.

No raw URL text should be visible to the end-user.

Successful Settings Update:

Once the image is uploaded and previewed successfully, clicking ‚ÄúUpdate PWA Settings‚Äù should save all values without errors.

Error messages should only appear if a required field is missing or the server validation fails.

üîç Developer Checklist:
[Frontend] Hide Static URL Text:

Remove or hide any visible text showing the file URL next to the image.

Confirm that the image preview is loaded directly via the src attribute.

[Frontend] Check Form Data Payload:

Verify the icon URL is included as part of the form data being sent (not excluded due to state mismatch or invalid field).

Use console logs or dev tools to confirm the POST/PUT request payload contains all updated fields, including the icon URL.

[Backend] Debug Update Route:

Ensure the backend correctly receives all fields and returns a success response.

Add logging or validation feedback to return a specific error instead of a generic "Failed to update".

[Validation] Ensure All Fields Are Valid:

Validate that:

App Name and Short Name are present and not over character limits.

Theme and Background Colors are valid hex codes.

Icon URL is a valid static file path (not null, undefined, or rejected in schema).

Add clear validation error messages to the response to help debug form-level issues.

‚úÖ Goal:
No URL or file path is shown in the UI.

The form updates all PWA settings, including the icon, without errors.

Any validation or failure returns a detailed error message, not a generic one.
