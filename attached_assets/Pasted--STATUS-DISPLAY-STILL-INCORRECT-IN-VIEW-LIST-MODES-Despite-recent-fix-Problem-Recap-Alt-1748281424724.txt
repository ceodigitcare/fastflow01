🚨 STATUS DISPLAY STILL INCORRECT IN VIEW & LIST MODES (Despite recent fix)

❗ Problem Recap:
Although the recent update claims status logic is unified and accurate, the bug **still persists**:
- **In Edit mode**, status shows correctly (e.g., `Paid`, `Received`)
- **In View and List modes**, the same bill incorrectly shows `Draft` or missing status.

---

### 🔍 Actual Case:
- Purchase Bill with:
  - 100% Payment Made
  - All Items Fully Received
- Status shown in Edit Mode: ✅ `Paid`, `Received`
- Status shown in View/List Mode: ❌ `Draft` or missing

This indicates that:
- **Either** status logic in View/List modes is still not using the correct function
- **Or** View/List modes are referencing outdated or incorrect data (e.g., stale props or backend response)

---

### 🧠 REQUIRED FIXES:

1. ✅ Ensure ALL views (Edit, View, List) use the same **shared utility function** for status calculation (like `getBillStatus()`).

2. ⚖️ Validate that **currency values** used for comparison are **normalized to the same unit** (either cents or dollars consistently) across all modes.

3. 🔁 Ensure **live backend values** are fetched and used on every render — avoid using cached or stale props/state for View/List.

4. 🧪 Add test cases with:
   - Full payment, full receive (should show `Paid`, `Received`)
   - Partial payment, full receive (should show `Partially Paid`, `Received`)
   - Full payment, partial receive (should show `Paid`, `Partially Received`)
   - No payment, full receive (should show `Unpaid`, `Received`)

5. 🧹 UI Clean-up:
   - ❌ No status display beside bill number in View mode
   - ✅ Text-only status badges (no icons)
   - ❌ Remove redundant "Current Status" block from Edit mode

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria:

- View mode and List mode match Edit mode status perfectly
- No hardcoded or default fallback statuses (`Draft`, etc.)
- Status reflects actual backend data — not assumptions
- Currency calculation bugs fully eliminated

---

💡 Final Note:
Please **double-check data mapping**, backend API response structure, and ensure View/List components are not using out-of-date status fields or separate logic branches.

I will verify again after fix — do not mark resolved unless status behaves correctly across all modes.
