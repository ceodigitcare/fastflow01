🚨 Status Display & Logic Issues in Purchase Bills — Please Fix All Points Below

---

### 1. ❌ Missing Status in View & List Modes

Currently, I can only see the status (e.g. Draft, Received, Paid) while editing a purchase bill.

✅ Required Fix:
- Ensure the **status badge appears in both "Purchase Bill View" and "Purchase Bill List"** views
- The display must be **consistent across all modes (Edit, View, and List)**

---

### 2. ❌ Incorrect Received Status Logic

Current behavior:
- If I receive **only 1 out of 2 items**, it still marks the status as **"Received"**

✅ Required Fix:
- Status must follow these rules:
  - If **all items are fully received**, show: `Received`
  - If **some items are received, and some pending**, show: `Partially Received`

### 3. ❌ Remove Unnecessary Elements

- ✅ The **"Cancel" icon or small button** next to status badges should be **removed**
- ✅ The **"Current Status" section at the bottom** of the edit screen is **not needed** — please remove this block entirely

---

### 4. ✅ Data Integrity Check (Double Confirm)

Please double-check:
- That all status calculations are based on real-time bill data (not cached or stale state)
- That received quantities, payments, and other fields are correctly evaluated
- That status changes are only triggered by actual changes in data (not UI artifacts)

🧪 Testing Instructions:

- Open a bill with 2+ items
- Receive only some of them → Status should say: `Partially Received`
- Receive all items → Status should say: `Received`
- Navigate to bill view and list view → Status badge must appear correctly
- Confirm there’s no cancel icon or “Current Status” block in edit mode

---

🎯 Summary:

Please ensure status display and logic is fully consistent, accurate, and minimal. All visual clutter (cancel icon, extra blocks) should be removed. Logic for `Received` vs `Partially Received` must be precise. Perform a full double-check of status computation integrity.
