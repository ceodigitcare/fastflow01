 Status & Freeze Functionality Issues (Updated)
Following recent improvements, status now displays correctly in the Purchase View and List screens. However, several critical issues remain unresolved or have regressed:

❌ Issue 1: Incorrect Status in Edit Mode
When editing a purchase bill, the status sometimes displays incorrectly or not in sync with the actual payment and receiving data.

In some cases, the status shown during edit does not match what is shown in view or list mode.

✅ Expected Behavior:

Status must be accurately computed and displayed in edit mode, just like in view and list modes.

Ensure consistent logic for status rendering across all modes (Edit, View, List).

Status must reflect:

Draft, Paid, Partial Paid, Received, Partial Received

and their valid combinations (e.g., Paid & Received).

❌ Issue 2: Freeze Button Completely Non-Functional
Previously, the Freeze button worked instantly, although it did not persist after reload.

Now, the Freeze button does not function at all—clicking it does not lock the fields, and no visual state change occurs.

✅ Expected Behavior:

Clicking "Freeze" should immediately:

Change button state to "Frozen"

Disable all editable fields (vendor, bank/cash, date, items, quantity, payments, etc.)

This frozen state must persist after saving or reloading the bill.

Manual unfreeze (via button) must be required before making any edits.

❌ Issue 3: Remove Icons from Status Badges
The small icons currently displayed beside status labels should be removed.

The color-coded status badge text is sufficient for visual clarity.

✅ Expected Behavior:

Status badges should show text only, with consistent colors (e.g., green for Paid, yellow for Partial, gray for Draft, etc.)

Remove any status-related icons from all views (edit, view, and list).

Please recheck the related logic, especially:

State handling and reactivity for freeze/unfreeze

Status calculation consistency across modes

Conditional UI rendering of status elements

Let me know once this has been fixed so I can re-test.
