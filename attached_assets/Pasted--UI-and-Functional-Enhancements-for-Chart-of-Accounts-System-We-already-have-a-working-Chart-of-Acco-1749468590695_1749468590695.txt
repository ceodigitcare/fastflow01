 UI and Functional Enhancements for Chart of Accounts System
We already have a working Chart of Accounts (COA) system with proper category-based structure and smart account codes (e.g., A0001). Your task is to enhance the existing interface and behavior with the following refinements. Do not rebuild the COA system from scratch.

üé® UI Design & Behavior Updates
1. Account Description Field: Input & Display
The account description field should appear as a single-line input when creating or editing an account.

In the main Chart of Accounts list view, show the account description exactly the same way category descriptions are displayed‚Äîi.e., smaller, subdued text below the account name.

2. Initial Balance & Active Status Layout
During account creation/editing, show:

Initial Balance field

Active checkbox or toggle

Place both elements side by side on the same row to save vertical space and maintain layout consistency.

3. Account Edit & Delete Icons
Each account row must display Edit and Delete icons identical to those used for categories.
üëâ Use the same style, placement, and icon set as currently used in category rows.
Do not introduce custom or different icons.

4. Delete Logic with Confirmation & Restrictions
If an account has any transactions, prevent deletion and display a warning modal:

‚ÄúThis account cannot be deleted because it has existing transactions.‚Äù

If the account has no transactions, allow deletion but show a confirmation prompt:

‚ÄúAre you sure you want to delete this account? This action cannot be undone.‚Äù

Once deleted, remove the account visually and from the database.

üñ•Ô∏è Summary of Feature Enhancements
 Inline, single-line account description field.

 Display account description like category descriptions: small, secondary text under name.

 Initial Balance + Active toggle: shown side by side.

 Use same Edit/Delete icons as categories (style, behavior, alignment).

 Prevent deletion if transactions exist, with a clear message.

 Show confirmation modal for accounts without transactions before deleting.

 All accounts should remain fully editable (name, description, balance, status).
