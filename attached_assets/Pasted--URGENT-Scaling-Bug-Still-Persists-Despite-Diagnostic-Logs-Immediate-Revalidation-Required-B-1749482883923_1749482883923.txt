🚨 URGENT: Scaling Bug Still Persists Despite Diagnostic Logs – Immediate Revalidation Required

Based on the latest visual test (input: `13.92`, displayed: `$139.20`), the ×10 scaling error **still exists**, indicating that the current diagnostic system is **not effectively tracking or solving the root cause**.

This suggests one or more of the following:

---

### ❗ Likely Root Causes (Recheck Immediately)

1. **The input value is already pre-scaled before calling `toCents()`**  
   - Meaning `13.92` is being transformed to `139.2` even before the `*100` happens.  
   - This results in `139.2 * 100 = 13920` cents ⇒ `$139.20`

2. **There is a silent coercion or intermediate transformation happening in the form input field**  
   - Example: `parseFloat(value) * 10` or a locale-based misinterpretation (e.g. comma as decimal separator)

3. **Your `toCents()` is correct, but the input passed into it is already corrupt**

4. **The displayed value is mistakenly calling `fromCents()` on an already-decimal number**  
   - Example: if backend sends `13.92` and UI shows `13.92 / 100 = 0.1392 → $0.14`, OR
   - backend sends `1392` and UI multiplies again ⇒ `$139.20`

### 🔍 REQUIRED ACTIONS (Do These Again, Thoroughly)

1. 🔁 **Refactor `toCents(value)` and `fromCents(value)` as pure functions:**
   ```ts
   const toCents = (value: string | number) => Math.round(parseFloat(value) * 100);
   const fromCents = (value: number) => (value / 100).toFixed(2);


🧪 Add console.log for each of these stages (again!):


✅ What’s captured from the input field (exact raw string)


✅ What’s stored in form state


✅ What value is passed to toCents()


✅ What toCents() returns


✅ What is sent to the API


✅ What comes back from API


✅ What is passed into fromCents() before displaying


🧼 Sanitize input so that only one transformation happens:


No repeated *100 or *10 steps


Confirm no multiplication inside onChange, useEffect, or useFormik


✅ Hard-code test with a known good value:

 js

const initialBalance = "13.92";
const cents = toCents(initialBalance); // Should be 1392
console.log({ initialBalance, cents });


⚠️ Confirm that the API doesn’t do another ×10 inside a backend formatter or serializer






✅ Final Expected Behavior
Input Value
Stored (Cents)
Displayed
13.92
     1392
$13.92
1
    100
$1.00
123.45
    12345
$123.45

Please use this updated prompt as a precise checklist to revalidate and re-debug the full flow, especially around input parsing and transformation. The scaling bug cannot be considered resolved until the actual numeric consistency is visually and programmatically verified.
