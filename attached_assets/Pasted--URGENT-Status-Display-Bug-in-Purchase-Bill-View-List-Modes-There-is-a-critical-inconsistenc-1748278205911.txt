🚨 URGENT: Status Display Bug in Purchase Bill View & List Modes

There is a critical inconsistency between the status shown in Edit mode and the status shown in View and List modes for Purchase Bills.

---

### 🧪 Observed Behavior:

- In **Edit Mode**, the status appears correctly:
  - Example: A bill where all items are fully received and full payment is made shows `Paid` and `Received` statuses properly.
- In **View Mode** and **List Mode**, **only `Received` or `Partially Received`** is shown — the `Paid` or `Partially Paid` status is missing even though the payment is complete.

---

### ❗ Required Fixes:

1. ✅ **Status Consistency Across All Views**:
   - Make sure that the **combined status** (e.g., `Paid`, `Partially Paid`, `Received`, `Partially Received`) is accurately calculated and displayed in:
     - Purchase Bill **View** mode
     - Purchase Bill **List** mode

2. 🔄 **Ensure Status Is Calculated From Saved Bill Data**:
   - Status should reflect actual data saved in the backend:
     - Total amount due
     - Amount paid
     - Received quantity of each item
   - Recalculate status on component load from saved bill data, not just from local form state.

3. ❌ **Do NOT Show Partial Status** Based on Partial Item Receipt Only:
   - A bill should show:
     - `Received` **only when all items are fully received**
     - `Partially Received` if **at least one item is not fully received**
   - Similarly, `Paid` only if full payment is made, otherwise `Partially Paid`

4. 🧹 **Double Check All Modes**:
   - Verify all status logic works in:
     - Edit Mode ✅
     - View Mode ❌ currently broken — must be fixed
     - List Mode ❌ currently broken — must be fixed

5. ❌ Do not assume fix is done until:
   - You fully test a bill with:
     - Multiple items
     - Full payment made
     - All items received
   - The correct status (`Paid`, `Received`) shows across **ALL three views**.

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria:

- Status must be identical in Edit, View, and List views.
- Must reflect **actual saved backend state**, not local form context.
- Must show both `Paid` and `Received` if applicable.
- No icons next to statuses.
- No status display next to bill number in View mode header.

💡 Note:

Please re-test thoroughly and confirm this issue is **100% fixed** before closing the task. This is a **data display bug**, not a form state bug.
