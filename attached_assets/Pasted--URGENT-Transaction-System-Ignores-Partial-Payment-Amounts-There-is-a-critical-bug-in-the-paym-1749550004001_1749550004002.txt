🚨 URGENT: Transaction System Ignores Partial Payment Amounts

There is a critical bug in the payment handling logic for purchase bills.

---

## 🧾 Problem Summary:

A bill (e.g., `#BILL-20250610-3688`) was created with a total of **$15.00**.

- A partial payment of **$10.00** was applied.
- The bill correctly shows **$5.00 due**.
- ✅ Bill-level UI reflects the correct payment status.
- ❌ However, the **created payment transaction** records **$15.00** as paid.
- ❌ The Chart of Accounts and Bank ledger also reflect **$15.00 debit**, which is incorrect.

---

## 🧠 Root Cause Hypothesis:

The transaction creation logic likely pulls the `bill.totalAmount` instead of the actual `payment.amount` when generating the journal entry.

---

## 🔍 Action Items:

1. **Review the transaction mutation or handler for payment submissions.**
   - Specifically look at:
     ```ts
     amount = bill.totalAmount; // ❌ Wrong
     amount = payment.amount;   // ✅ Correct
     ```

2. **Verify that the transaction ledger only reflects the actual paid amount (partial or full).**

3. **Ensure that Chart of Accounts and Bank account are only impacted by the actual cash movement.**

## ✅ Example Test Case:

| Scenario                | Input     | Expected Ledger Entry |
|-------------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Bill Total              | $15.00    |                        |
| Partial Payment         | $10.00    | $10.00 Bank → Payables |
| Remaining Balance Due   | $5.00     | Unchanged              |
| Current Implementation  | $10.00    | ❌ Bank shows $15.00   |

## 🛡️ Security Reminder:

As this system handles financial data, ensure:
- All monetary fields are validated in cents.
- All mutations log `payment.amount`, not `bill.amount`.
- Avoid trusting frontend totals; always derive from `paymentPayload.amount`.

Please fix this as a priority. Let me know if you need trace logs or example payloads.
