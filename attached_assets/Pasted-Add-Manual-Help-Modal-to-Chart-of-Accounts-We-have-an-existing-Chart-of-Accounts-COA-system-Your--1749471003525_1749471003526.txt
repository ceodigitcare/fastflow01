Add Manual Help Modal to Chart of Accounts
We have an existing Chart of Accounts (COA) system. Your task is to add a help/documentation modal to assist users in understanding how to manage categories and accounts.

📌 UI Integration
Next to the "Add Category" button, place a small question mark icon (?).

The icon should be visually subtle and aligned to the right side of the button.

When clicked, it will open a modal window (similar to the product variant modal) that displays a well-structured English-language user manual for the COA system.

📘 Manual Content (To Display in Modal)

🖨️ Printing the Chart of Accounts
Use the "Print" button at the top-right corner to print or save the full Chart of Accounts list.

The print view includes all categories, accounts, and their descriptions.

🔄 Expand All / Collapse All
Use "Expand All" to open all category groups and display their accounts.

Use "Collapse All" to hide all account listings and show only top-level categories.

🔍 Viewing Transaction Info
Click on any account row to open a transaction summary modal or panel (depending on the system setup).

It shows recent transactions, balances, and account activity history.

🧩 Modal Design Suggestion
The manual modal should follow the same styling as the modal used in the Product Variant section.

Use clear headings, icons, bullet points, and sections for readability.
