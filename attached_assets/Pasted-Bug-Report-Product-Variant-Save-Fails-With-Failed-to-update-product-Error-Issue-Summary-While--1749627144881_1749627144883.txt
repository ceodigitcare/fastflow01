Bug Report: Product Variant Save Fails With “Failed to update product” Error
Issue Summary:
While trying to save a product with variants, the frontend shows the error message:
"Failed to update product. Please try again."
This happens only when variants are added. Products without variants save correctly.

✅ Expected Behavior:
User creates a product

Adds variants (e.g. Color: Black, SKU: 6550C, Inventory: 10)

Clicks Save

The product and its variants should persist successfully

❌ Actual Behavior:
Variants generate successfully in the UI

On clicking Save, the red error box appears:
"Failed to update product. Please try again."

Product is not saved, and no network/log explanation is visible to the user

🧪 Possible Root Cause:
Payload mismatch between frontend and backend

Backend may expect a nested array like:

json

{
  "variants": [
    {
      "attributes": { "Color": "Black" },
      "sku": "6550C",
      "inventory": 10
    }
  ]
}
But frontend may be sending:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "sku": "6550C",
  "inventory": 10,
  "variant": "Black"
}
Missing required keys (e.g. attributes, price, or product_id) may also cause backend rejection

📋 Steps to Reproduce:
Go to Edit Product

Add Variant: Color → Black

Set SKU: 6550C and Inventory: 10

Click Save

Error message shown, nothing saved

🛠️ Suggested Fix:
Inspect the actual JSON payload being sent on save

Align the frontend variant structure to match the backend schema

Ensure each variant includes:

sku (optional but unique if present)

inventory (required)

attributes (required: object with key-value of variant types)

(Optional) price

Return more meaningful error messages from backend to help debugging

🔁 Optional: Example Working Payload (Expected)
json

{
  "name": "Urban Laptop Backpack",
  "variants": [
    {
      "attributes": {
        "Color": "Black"
      },
      "sku": "6550C",
      "inventory": 10
    }
  ]
}
This issue is blocking variant-based product functionality. Please prioritize this fix. If needed, I can supply request/response logs for deeper inspection.
