Chart of Accounts System Adjustment
We have an existing Chart of Accounts system with pre-defined structure, icons, layout, and UI language. Please make the following adjustments strictly following the current system‚Äôs patterns and components.

üéØ Required Changes
Remove Dashboard Header Section
On the "Chart of Accounts" page, completely remove the header/dashboard section that includes:

"Finances", "Manage your business finances and track revenue"

Metrics such as Total Revenue, Monthly Revenue, Total Orders, Profit Margin

The New Transaction button

Tab links such as Overview, Transactions, etc.

‚úÖ Keep the layout clean and focused only on Chart of Accounts. The background page should not include the red-marked dashboard segment (see attached image).

Use System Icons and Texts Only

Do not use new icons or styles.

Use the same icons, colors, text labels, tooltips, and interaction flow already used in the current COA system.

For edit and delete icons on accounts, reuse the exact same icons used for categories (üñâ and üóëÔ∏è or their system equivalents).

All button texts, modals, and confirmation dialogs must follow existing terminology and structure.

Follow Existing UI/UX Logic

All edit/delete modals, confirmations, form fields, and toggles should behave exactly the same as they currently do for categories.

Do not introduce new patterns or processes. Just extend current patterns to accounts where needed.

Recheck Prompt from Previous Instruction

Keep the account description field as a single-line input.

Display account descriptions in the Chart of Accounts view, just like how category descriptions are shown.

Place Initial Balance and Active checkbox on the same row.

Make all accounts editable, and deletable only if they have no transactions.

Show proper warning before deletion, including a message when deletion is blocked due to existing transactions.

This prompt ensures minimal disruption and maximum consistency with the current system's behavior and design language. Do not implement anything new unless it mirrors existing functionality.
