Combined Issues with Logout, PWA Icon, Auth Error, and UI Design
1️⃣ Logout Issue (Auto-login After Logout)
When I click "Logout", I am briefly redirected to the login page, but then automatically logged back into the dashboard without any input.

This issue persists until I manually clear the browser cache.

This suggests that authentication tokens (e.g., cookies or localStorage) are not being properly cleared on logout.

Expected Fix:

Ensure logout function fully removes all session data (JWT, refresh token, localStorage/cookies).

Prevent automatic re-authentication if the user hasn't explicitly logged in.

2️⃣ Authentication Error When Updating PWA Settings
When I try to update anything in the PWA Settings tab (like changing the icon), I receive this error:
"Authentication failed. Please refresh the page and login again."

This happens even though I am clearly logged in and able to navigate other sections.

Expected Fix:

Check if token expiry or CSRF protection is causing this.

Make sure authenticated routes in the backend correctly verify user identity.

Frontend should gracefully handle token expiration and avoid triggering updates with invalid credentials.

3️⃣ PWA Settings UI Design Issue
The PWA Settings tab creates a vertical scrollbar, even when there is minimal content.

When I scroll to the bottom, an unnecessary blank area appears on the right-hand side of the screen.

This layout issue only happens inside the PWA tab and breaks the otherwise clean UI.

Expected Fix:

Review container and layout styling (e.g., padding, margins, min-height, overflow behavior).

Ensure no unnecessary whitespace is rendered on the right side when scrolling.

4️⃣ PWA Install Icon Shows Default Icon Instead of Custom One
After uploading a custom app icon in the PWA tab, the browser’s install icon (top-right corner) still shows the default icon.

It seems like the manifest.json is not picking up the uploaded icon path properly or not regenerating after update.

Expected Fix:

Ensure manifest.json is being dynamically rebuilt after each PWA settings update.

Clear browser cache or use cache-busting headers to avoid loading stale manifest/icon.

Make sure the icon path is absolute and publicly accessible (e.g., /uploads/icon-512x512.png).

✅ Final Goal:
Logout should fully clear authentication and prevent silent re-login.

Updating PWA settings should work without auth errors.

PWA tab UI should be clean with no unnecessary scroll or spacing.

Browser install icon should use the updated app icon, not the default.
