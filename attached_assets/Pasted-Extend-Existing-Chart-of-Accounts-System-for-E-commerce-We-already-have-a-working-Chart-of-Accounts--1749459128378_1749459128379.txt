Extend Existing Chart of Accounts System for E-commerce
We already have a working Chart of Accounts (COA) system with a smart and consistent account code format (e.g., A0001 - Cash & Bank). Do not change or replace the current numbering system.

Your task is to enhance the existing COA module by extending it for e-commerce use with the following specific instructions:

🔧 Enhancement Scope
1. Use Existing Numbering Format
Continue using the current intelligent account code format (e.g., A0001, L0002, E0005) for all default and user-created accounts.

Do not introduce new numeric or 4-digit coding schemes like 1010, 2020, etc.

2. Attach Accounts Directly to Categories
Allow adding new accounts directly under existing categories from the UI.

There should be an "Add Account" button under each category to streamline quick entry.

3. Auto-Create Common E-commerce Categories and Accounts
Add the following system-tagged categories and accounts automatically upon setup.

These should be non-deletable, clearly marked with a "system" tag, and shown as fixed/default items.

Users may only create/edit/delete non-system-tagged categories/accounts.

📦 Default Categories and Accounts (System-Tagged)
🟦 Assets
Cash & Bank (already exists, retain as-is)

Inventory

Accounts Receivable

Advance to Supplier

Office Equipment

🟥 Liabilities
Bank Loan

Accounts Payable

Taxes Payable

Customer Advances

🟩 Equity
Owner's Capital

Retained Earnings

Drawings

🟨 Income
Sales Revenue

Shipping Income

Discount Received

Interest Income

🟧 Expense
Cost of Goods Sold

Advertising & Marketing

Payment Gateway Charges

Rent & Utilities

Internet & Communication

Salaries & Wages

Packaging Materials

Software Subscriptions

Office Supplies

All of the above should be initialized with system tags and follow the existing smart code format (A000X, L000X, E000X, etc.), matched appropriately to the category.

✏️ User Permissions and Flexibility
Users can create additional custom categories and accounts.

System-tagged items must not be deletable, but custom ones can be edited or removed.

Users may rename custom accounts or assign them under any existing or new category.

🖥️ UI Behavior
In the Chart of Accounts screen:

Display an "Add new account" option directly below each category.

System-tagged items must be shown with a visual label (e.g., lock icon or "system" tag) and cannot be deleted.
