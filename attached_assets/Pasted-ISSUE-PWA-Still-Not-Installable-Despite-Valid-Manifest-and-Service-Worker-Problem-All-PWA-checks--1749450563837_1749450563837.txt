ISSUE: PWA Still Not Installable Despite Valid Manifest and Service Worker
Problem:
All PWA checks (Manifest, HTTPS, Service Worker) are now passing ✅, but the app is still not installable — the install icon does not appear in the browser’s address bar, and no install prompt is triggered.

🎯 GOAL
Ensure the PWA meets all installability requirements so users can see the install icon and install the app directly from their browser.

🔍 CHECKLIST TO FIX INSTALLABILITY
Please verify and address the following issues:

Manifest Icons

Ensure the icon in the manifest.json has a valid, public, HTTPS URL (not blob: or local dev paths).

Use this format:

json
Copy
Edit
"icons": [
  {
    "src": "/icon-512x512.png",
    "sizes": "512x512",
    "type": "image/png"
  }
]
Icon must be exactly 512x512 pixels for installability.

Service Worker Scope

Confirm the Service Worker is registered with the correct scope ('/') and is controlling the page:

js
Copy
Edit
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js', { scope: '/' })
Use navigator.serviceWorker.controller in the console to verify it's active.

Start URL

Manifest must include a start_url that matches your root route:

json
Copy
Edit
"start_url": "/?source=pwa"
Display Mode

Ensure the display property is set to "standalone" in the manifest:

json
Copy
Edit
"display": "standalone"
Secure Context

Double-check that all URLs (including icon src and start_url) are served over HTTPS and not from dev-only blob or data URLs.

No Page Reloads During SW Registration

Make sure the Service Worker is registered before any page reloads occur — some browsers skip the install prompt if the page reloads too early.

Install Prompt Handling (Optional)

You can optionally capture and manually show the install prompt for more control:

js
Copy
Edit
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  window.deferredPrompt = e;
  // Show custom install button here if needed
});
🧪 RECOMMENDED TESTING
Open DevTools → Application tab → Manifest → check for installability warnings

Go to Chrome → open the PWA URL → check if the install icon appears in the address bar

Use Lighthouse → check for "Installable" score and follow recommendations
