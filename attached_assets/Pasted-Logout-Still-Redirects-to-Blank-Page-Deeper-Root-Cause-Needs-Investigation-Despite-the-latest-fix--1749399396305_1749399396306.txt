Logout Still Redirects to Blank Page ‚Äî Deeper Root Cause Needs Investigation
Despite the latest fix using window.location.replace() and updates to the ProtectedRoute logic, the logout issue persists ‚Äî the app continues to show a blank screen instead of redirecting to the login page.

üêû Current Observations:
Clicking "Logout" triggers session/token clearing

The browser does not show the login UI; instead, it loads a blank page (white screen)

Manually refreshing after logout sometimes loads the login screen correctly ‚Äî indicating the routing or render logic is not executing after auth state change

üîç Suggested Areas to Investigate:
1. Routing Flow After Logout
Ensure window.location.replace('/login') or navigate('/login') is placed after session state is cleared (not before).

If using React Router, verify that the /login route is correctly declared and not conditionally rendered based on auth.

2. AuthProvider & Context Update
Ensure the AuthProvider context correctly updates the auth state on logout.

The consumer of the context (e.g., App.tsx, ProtectedRoute) must react to the state change and trigger route update.

Add console.log() inside AuthProvider and ProtectedRoute to confirm flow during logout.

3. Null Component Render
There may still be a return null or fallback component rendering undefined while routing or auth check is pending.

Confirm that the logout state does not leave the component tree in an empty/unmounted state.

4. Component Mounting Order
Ensure no race conditions between useEffect, routing, and context update that prevent the login route from rendering.

‚úÖ Expected Behavior:
After clicking "Logout", users should be redirected cleanly and immediately to /login with no blank screen.

No white page, flash, or render delay should occur.

Please review and resolve the routing and auth state flow at a deeper level ‚Äî this issue appears persistent and may be caused by improper state sequencing or conditional rendering during logout.

Let me know once it's addressed and stable.
