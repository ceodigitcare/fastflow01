PWA App Icon Not Reflecting After Update in Installed App Button
Although the updated PWA icon is correctly saved to the database and included in the generated manifest.json, the install button (in the browser address bar) still shows the old/default icon instead of the newly uploaded one.

üîç Issue Summary:
Custom icon uploads are successful and saved correctly (no blob URLs)


manifest.json shows correct new icon with static URL (e.g., /uploads/icon-512.png)


Browser continues to show the old icon in the install popup/app list


Even after reinstalling, the app uses the outdated icon


Manifest and service worker cache may not reflect the updated icon



‚úÖ Possible Causes to Investigate:
Service Worker & Manifest Caching


Old manifest or icon may be cached by the service worker or browser


Ensure proper cache busting is applied using versioning or URL query (e.g., icon-512.png?v=2)


Update service-worker.js to bypass cache for the manifest and app icon


Manifest Meta Tag


Confirm that the <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"> is correctly updated and not hardcoded with an old URL


Reinstall Behavior


PWA installation might still use previously cached icon; full uninstall and reinstall should force refresh ‚Äî if not, caching rules are too aggressive


MIME Type Validation


Ensure the uploaded icon is served with correct MIME type (image/png) and status code 200 OK



üõ† Recommended Fix:
Implement cache-busting (e.g., using ?v=[timestamp]) on icon and manifest URLs


Add a cache clear mechanism in service-worker.js when app icon changes


Ensure the service worker installs a fresh version of the manifest when any PWA setting changes



üí° Final Expectation:
Once fixed, the PWA install prompt will reflect the newly uploaded app icon immediately or after clearing browser cache/installing fresh ‚Äî without showing the old/default icon.
Please help investigate and ensure the app icon is dynamically updated across all install-related UI surfaces.
