PWA Icon Upload & UI Issues Persist – Deep Debugging Required
Despite multiple attempts to fix the PWA settings functionality, the core problems remain unresolved and require in-depth debugging rather than surface-level patches.

🚫 1. Icon Upload Fails Repeatedly
On the first upload attempt, I consistently get the error:
"Failed to upload icon."

On subsequent attempts, it changes to:
"Authentication failed. Please refresh the page and login again."

This suggests a token/session handling issue, possibly caused by:

Expired or invalid JWT tokens

Improper token refresh handling

Inconsistent usage of fetch vs a proper authenticated API client

Upload handler not verifying auth correctly in multer or route middleware

✅ Expected Fix:

Ensure the upload endpoint is properly protected and integrated with the session/token logic

Use centralized authenticated API client on frontend

Log and trace the exact request headers and server response to find where the auth breaks

🎨 2. PWA Tab UI – Scrolling Bug Still Exists
The scrolling behavior is broken specifically in the PWA settings tab:

A vertical scrollbar always appears even when there’s little content

Scrolling reveals blank white space on the right-hand side of the screen

This affects the UX and looks visually broken.

✅ Expected Fix:

Review container styles (overflow, padding, margin, flex/grid behavior)

Inspect any wrapping div or layout that might be enforcing extra width or height

Test with real content vs empty content to ensure consistency

🧩 3. Underlying Issues Are Recurring
These issues (upload failure, auth error, layout bug) keep resurfacing despite previous patch responses claiming resolution.

It appears previous fixes are not addressing root causes, or are being overwritten by partial implementations or cached files.

✅ Request:
Please perform a deep dive debugging session focused on:

Token validation, storage, and refresh logic

File upload middleware (especially how icons are handled)

Manifest.json regeneration and cache control

CSS/HTML layout of the PWA settings tab

Use server-side logs, console errors, and network requests to identify where the process is breaking — instead of assuming fixes based on visible symptoms.

🔁 Final Goal:
I need a fully stable PWA settings tab where:

Icon uploads work reliably with no auth issues

Layout is clean and scrolls properly

Settings persist and manifest.json reflects updates dynamically

Logout behaves properly without ghost re-authentication
