PWA Manifest Loads But Install Icon Not Showing — Installability Fails in Browser
Although the manifest.json appears to load correctly and includes the required fields (name, short_name, start_url, display, icons, theme_color, etc.), the browser does not show the PWA install icon in the address bar, and the app is not being recognized as installable.

🔍 Key Observations:
Manifest is reachable and valid in DevTools


Service worker is registered successfully


App is served over HTTPS


No critical manifest errors in the console


However, beforeinstallprompt event does not fire, and install icon does not appear in Chrome or Edge



✅ Checklist to Reconfirm:
Please ensure the following are correctly implemented:
Manifest File Requirements


"display" is set to "standalone" or "minimal-ui"


"start_url" is relative (e.g., "/" or "./")


Valid "icons" array with at least one icon (512x512) and proper MIME type ("image/png")


Service Worker


Service worker is registered and controls the start URL


At least one fetch handler is present to enable offline capability


HTTPS & Scope


App is served via HTTPS


"scope" in manifest (if provided) must match or contain the start_url


User Engagement


Chrome only triggers installability if the user has interacted with the page (e.g., clicked or stayed for a few seconds)


Avoid Auto-Redirection


Any auto-redirect (e.g., from / to /dashboard) can break installability


Ensure that start_url remains under service worker scope and no redirects interfere



🧪 Suggested Next Steps:
Confirm that beforeinstallprompt event is being listened to correctly in your code (e.g., window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', ...))


Manually test installability via Chrome DevTools > Application tab > Manifest → Should show “Installable”


Review if caching or misconfigured response headers prevent installability



🔁 Expected Outcome:
Once properly configured, the browser should display the PWA install icon in the address bar (or overflow menu) and allow installation with the custom icon.
Please investigate this behavior and ensure all installability requirements are fully met and debugged.
