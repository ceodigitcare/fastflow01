Persistent Bug: "Received Quantity" Still Resets to Zero on Edit
Despite several attempts and structural overhauls, the receivedQuantity values are still not retained when editing a saved purchase bill. Numerous fixes have been claimed, including:

Multi-level data retrieval from metadata, items, and processed states

Logging at each data extraction and population step

Prioritization logic for quantity sources

Manual form manipulation after state setting

Explicit input field bindings

However, the issue remains unresolved.

üìå Clear Problem Summary:
When I create and save a purchase bill with received quantities ‚Äî the data is saved without errors.

But when I reopen the bill for editing, all receivedQuantity values reset to zero instead of showing previously saved values.

This behavior breaks inventory accuracy and creates serious inconsistency in business workflows.

üõ†Ô∏è Developer Instructions:
Please review and debug the issue from the ground up, ensuring the following:

1. Verify Data Persistence in the Database
Ensure the correct receivedQuantity values are actually being saved (whether under items[], metadata, or a combined structure).

Check for any overwrites or omissions in the backend before data is returned to the frontend on edit.

2. Form Initialization Logic
Inspect how the form is populated when entering "edit mode".

Ensure that receivedQuantity is being:

Correctly extracted

Matched by item/product ID

Bound properly to each input field

3. Debug State Synchronization
Ensure no intermediate state resets or overrides are zeroing out the quantities after they are set.

Watch for useEffect or re-render side effects that may reset input values unexpectedly.

4. Add Debug Logging (if missing)
Log the values being:

Fetched from backend

Mapped to form state

Assigned to each input field

This will help trace exactly where the reset occurs.

5. Test End-to-End
Save a bill with received quantities.

Reload it and confirm the correct data is:

Returned from the backend

Mapped to each product/item

Populated in the input fields with no loss

‚ùóFinal Note:
This issue has been reported multiple times and cannot be considered fixed until:

Previously saved received quantities are reliably shown during every edit session.

The system maintains full data fidelity between save and edit operations.

Please treat this as a critical functional bug and recheck all layers (backend, data mapping, form state, UI rendering) accordingly.
