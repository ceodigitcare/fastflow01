Please redesign and rebuild the Product Variant Management system within the Add/Edit Product panel, ensuring full functionality, minimal space usage, and intuitive user experience.

üß± System Overview
The current "Add Variant" button does not respond or open any input fields. We need to rebuild the entire variant management module with full functionality and a clean, space-conscious design suitable for a tabbed modal layout.

‚úÖ Functional Requirements
Add Variant Group

Allow user to create variant types (e.g., Size, Color).

Variant group name input (e.g., ‚ÄúSize‚Äù).

Multiple values can be added for a group (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).

Support multiple groups (e.g., Size + Color = 9 combinations total if 3 each).

Auto-Generate Variant Combinations

Once values are entered, auto-generate all possible variant combinations in a scrollable table.

Each row = one combination (e.g., Medium + Blue).

Editable Fields per Variant
For each combination row, allow user to enter:

SKU

Price (optional override)

Stock Quantity

(Optional) Barcode or custom field

Delete Variant Group or Values

User can delete entire variant group or individual variant values.

Changing groups should re-calculate combinations dynamically.

üí° UX/UI Guidelines
Use accordion or collapsible group sections if needed to minimize space.

Display the variant table inside a scrollable container with fixed height (~250‚Äì300px max).

Make ‚ÄúAdd Variant‚Äù clearly visible and styled as a primary button.

Display a short helper text:
‚ÄúAdd variant types like Size or Color to offer different versions of this product.‚Äù

‚ö†Ô∏è Validation Rules
Do not allow creation of a variant group with empty values.

Show inline warnings if SKU is duplicated across combinations.

Ensure at least one variant must be filled if a group is added.

Once implemented, this will allow fully dynamic, scalable variant handling within limited modal/tab space while maintaining user clarity and ease of use.

Let me know if you want a wireframe sketch of the proposed UI layout as well.
