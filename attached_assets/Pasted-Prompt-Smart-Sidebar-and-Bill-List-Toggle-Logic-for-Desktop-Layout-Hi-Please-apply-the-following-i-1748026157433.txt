Prompt: Smart Sidebar and Bill List Toggle Logic for Desktop Layout
Hi! Please apply the following intelligent behavior to the desktop version of the Purchase Bill UI to ensure intuitive control over both side panels (left sidebar and right bill list):

‚úÖ LEFT SIDEBAR (Main Menu)
By default, on desktop, show the left sidebar with a cross (√ó) icon placed next to the Storefront label.

Clicking the cross (√ó) should hide the sidebar completely.

Once hidden, the cross should disappear and be replaced by a hamburger icon (‚â°) at the top-left.

Clicking the hamburger icon should re-show the sidebar and replace the hamburger with the cross again.

Ensure that both icons are never visible at the same time ‚Äî only one should be visible depending on the menu state.

When the sidebar is hidden, the main Purchase Bill view must auto-expand to use the freed-up space.

‚úÖ RIGHT SIDE (Purchase Bill List)
Add a three-line (‚â°) toggle icon to the far-right of the top bar, next to the user profile photo.

Clicking this icon should hide the right-side bill list panel.

When the list panel is hidden, show a small unobtrusive button or icon (‚â°) to bring it back, placed on the far right of the top bar.

When the list is hidden, the main Purchase Bill area should stretch to full width across the screen.

‚ùå Avoid Redundancy
Do not show both the cross and the hamburger icon together.

Do not show the hamburger icon when the menu is already open.

Remove any extra or floating toggle icons unrelated to this context (like the bottom-right FAB or middle-of-screen toggles).

üìê Layout Responsiveness
When both left sidebar and right bill list are hidden, the Purchase Bill section must expand to fill the full width of the screen for optimal readability.

Avoid large gaps between UI sections. The layout should contract and expand fluidly depending on visible panels.

This behavior should be global across all relevant screens using this layout structure.

Let me know if you need visual references or want this behavior implemented in code as well.
